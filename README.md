#  AirPodsMotion

An AirPods Pro motion detection in SwiftUI code.

This basic App is based on the code from  [AirPodsPro-Motion-Sampler](https://github.com/tukuyo/AirPodsPro-Motion-Sampler), but  using RealityKit in SwiftUI.

To make this work, add
*Privacy - Motion Usage Description* to the **Info.plist**.

To move the AirPods while in your hands, not in your ears,
on macOS do:

    System Settings → Bluetooth → AirPods (Options) → Automatic Ear Detection → Off


Could not make the App work on iOS, only on Mac Catalyst.
